# Custom Plank Board

Like the [Zephyr Example Application's](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/example-application/) `custom_plank` board, this fictional `adafruit_plank` board is used as an example for how boards are formatted. It is actually an STM32F405 Feather Express, so that hardware can be used for examples compiled with this board.
